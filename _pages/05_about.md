Hello everyone My name is Eli Gilmour and I am here to share a little bit of information as to who I am. I was born and raised in San Diego and i am 16 years old. For my whole life I have played baseball and have been on many different travel clubs and as of two years ago I made the switch to football, which I currently play for del norte. I love to play video games, cook, and hang out with friends.
