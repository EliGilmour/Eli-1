<ul>
  <li>A crowdsource idea for a school environment could be a student-led project to improve the school’s facilities or programs. We can achieve this by the Start of identifying an issue that the students, staff, or community members want to address, such as a lack of study spaces or a need for new equipment in the gym. Then Gathering information and resources, Conducting research to gather information about the problem and gather resources such as funds, materials, and volunteers. Lastly Launching the project, Once you have gathered the resources, launch the project and keep the community informed about its progress.</li>
</ul>

It would help us with creating new features and having great ideas with also helping with problem solving. This would be great it if had crowdsourcing.</li>
