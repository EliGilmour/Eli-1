  <li>I got this question wrong because I selected one of the two right answers and that I choose one where I didn’t need to include the else statement which was not needed. Next time I will look more throughly and think the problem out more.</li>

<ul>
  <li>I got this question wrong because I got the first part of the question right, but then it asked for two answers and I choose the one were it says to draw circle last instead of first in the block of code.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>I got this question wrong because If I am being honest, I did have to do some reaserch on this question and I got it wrong, but I know why I got it wrong and now I understand the question and why the correct answer is true.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>This test was something that was doable and something that really challenged my brain and their were a few hard problems that I needed help on and really picked my brain. I am glad that I keep on learning these new topics and practicing questions and getting to see many different blocks of code.</li>
