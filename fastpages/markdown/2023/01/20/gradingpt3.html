<p>1: I would give this submission a 1 on this row because the video demonstrates the inpu of the program, output, and the program Functionality.</p>

<p>2: I would give this submission a 1 on this row because includes two program code segments, one that shows how data has been stored in this list, and also one that shows the data in this same list being used as part of fulfilling the program’s purpose. Also the written response identifies the name of the variable representing the
list being used in this response.</p>

<p>3: I would give this submission a 0 on this row because The explanation of how the list manages complexity is implausible, inaccurate, or inconsistent withthe program. The solution without the list is implausible, inaccurate, or inconsistent with the program. The use of the list does not result in a program that is easier to develop, meaning alternatives presented are equally complex or potentially easier. The use of the list does not result in a program that is easier to maintain, meaning that future changes to the size of the list would cause significant modifications to the code.</p>

<p>4: I would give this submission a 1 on this row includes two program code segments, Abstraction one showing a student-developed procedure Requirements for program code segments,with at least one parameter that has an effect on the functionality of the procedure.</p>

<p>5: I would give this response a 0 on this row because The response only describes what the selected algorithm does without explaining how it does it. Also The description of the algorithm does not match the included program code. The code segment consisting of the selected algorithm is not included in the written response.</p>

<p>6: I would give this submission a 1 on this row because describes the condition being tested by each call to the procedure. Also identifies the result of each call.</p>

<p>1: I would give this submission a 1 becasue The video demonstrates the running of the program including Function input, program functionality, and output.</p>

<p>2: I would give this submission a 1 because te program includes two program code segments, one that shows how data has been stored in
this list and one that shows the data in this same list being
used as part of fulfilling the program’s purpose.</p>

<p>3: I would give this submission a 1 because teh response explains how the named, selected list manages complexity in the program code by explaining why the program code could not be written, or how it
would be written differently, without using this list.</p>

<p>4: I would give this submission a 1 because includes two program code segments, one showing a student-developed procedure Requirements for program code segments, with at least one parameter that has an effect
on the functionality of the procedure and one showing where the student-developed procedure is being called.</p>

<p>5: I would give this submission a 1 because the response includes a program code segment of a student Implementation developed algorithm that includes sequencing, selection and iteration</p>

<p>6: I would give this submission a 1 because I would give this submission a 1 on this row because describes the condition being tested by each call to the procedure. Also identifies the result of each call.</p>

<p>1: I would give this submission a 1 on this row because the video demonstrates the inpu of the program, output, and the program Functionality.</p>

<p>2: I would give this submission a 0 on this row because The list is a one-element list and The use of the list does not assist in fulfilling the program’s purpose. Also could use more details.</p>

<p>3: I would give thus submission a 1 on this row because the response includes a program code segment that shows a list Complexity being used to manage complexity in the program.</p>

<p>4: I would give this submission a 0 on this row because The code segment consisting of the procedure is not included in the written responses section. The procedure is a built-in or existing procedure or language structure, such as an event handler or main method, where the student only implements the body of the procedure rather than defining
the name, return type and parameters.</p>

<p>5: I would give this submission a 1 because the response includes a program code segment of a student Implementation developed algorithm that includes sequencing, selection and iteration</p>

<p>6: I would give this submission a 0 on this row because the procedure is not identified in written response 3c. The written response for 3d does not apply to the procedure in 3c. Also The two calls cause the same exact sequence of code in the algorithm to execute even if the
result is different.</p>
