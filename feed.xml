A programmer should care about space and time complexity because this is what creates and what is shown on your website and like for example, the bigger the image the more space it takes up. Do you think this is a time complexity or space complexity or both problem? This is a time and spcae problem because the bigger the photo, the longer it will take to load / process. If it is too big then there is not space for photo. You increase the bandwidth to increase the time. Small photo loads very fast while larger photo takes longer. Record your findings when testing the time elapsed of the different algorithms. Although we will go more in depth later, time complexity is a key concept that relates to the different sorting algorithms. Do some basic research on the different types of sorting algorithms and their time complexity.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Big Idea 2 Quiz Corrections</title><link href="https://eligilmour.github.io/Eli-1/fastpages/markdown/2023/03/21/big2quiz.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Big Idea 2 Quiz Corrections" /><published>2023-03-21T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-03-21T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://eligilmour.github.io/Eli-1/fastpages/markdown/2023/03/21/big2quiz</id><author><name>Eli gilmour</name></author><category term="fastpages" /><category term="markdown" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I scored 24/25]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Unit 2.4b Using Programs with Data, SQL</title><link href="https://eligilmour.github.io/Eli-1/2023/03/16/AP-unit2-4b.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Unit 2.4b Using Programs with Data, SQL" /><published>2023-03-16T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-03-16T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://eligilmour.github.io/Eli-1/2023/03/16/AP-unit2-4b</id><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Using Programs with Data is focused on SQL and database actions.
