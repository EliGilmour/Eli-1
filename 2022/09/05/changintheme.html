<h1 id="postitve-effects">Postitve effects</h1>

<p>The positive effects of changing the theme was that I learned that fastpages has different versions of how you can create and make your website look.</p>

<h1 id="negative-effects">Negative effects</h1>

<p>the negative effects of changing the theme was that It switched everything around and pushed it all the way to the left side of the screen and you canâ€™t use the top tabs that include about me, search, vocab, the table, and catergories which makes the theme not beneficial.</p>
