Whats the problem with Dopamine? Well having too much dopmaine is not good for you because it is linked to being more competitive, aggressive and having poor impulse control. It can also lead to conditions that include ADHD, binge eating, and addiction. It is not a parent conspiracy, Dopamine is a real neurotransmitter. Dopamine imbalances can be caused by genetic or environmental factors, such as drug use or certain medical conditions. For me personal I don't find an issue with dopmaine but I know some people who do which leads to them not paying attention and hard time staying focused.

# 1. 

### Learn about technology: Understanding how technology works and how to use it effectively can give you more control over your digital life.

### Get involved in online communities: Joining online communities that share your interests can be a great way to connect with like-minded people and learn new things.

### Learn how to code: Understanding how to code can give you more control over the technology you use and enable you to create your own digital tools and apps.

# 2. 

### Share knowledge and resources: Offer guidance and provide resources that can help the person gain the skills and knowledge they need to become more empowered.

### Provide mentorship: Offer support and guidance as the person navigates the digital world.

### Offer technical assistance: Provide hands-on help with setting up accounts, using software, or troubleshooting problems.

- If a student at Del Norte HS needed help on a problem that they have, say for example in coding, I could help them and give them assistance to what ever the problem is.

# 3. 

### paper-based systems and bureaucracy can be a barrier to digital empowerment. Say For example, if a government or organization still relies heavily on paper-based systems, it can make it difficult for citizens or employees to access services or information digitally. This can be due to a lack of digitization of official documents, or not having the infrastructure for digital systems. 

### Additionally, in some countries or regions with restricted internet access, lack of infrastructure, or government censorship can also be a barrier to digital empowerment.

# Intentional or Purposeful bias

- Google “What age groups use Facebook” vs “… TikTok”?
    - My take is that more of the older people use facebook than younger people ( teens ) and younger people use instagram more. Each app requires you to enter a birthday, but it is really easy to lie about the birthday. So there could be really young people on both apps with out knowing. I think it is harmful because their shouldn't be any young kids on both of these apps, because their is some cases of sensitive content.

- Why do virtual assistants have female voices?
    - Virtual assistans are usually female voices because many studies have found that female voices tend to articulate vowel sounds more clearly which makes them easier to understand. In my opinion, I find female voices more soothing.

- Talk about an algorithm that influences your decisions, think about these companies? (ie FAANG - Facebook, Amazon, Apple,Netflix, Google)
    - One algorithm that influences decisions made by several of these companies is the recommendation algorithm. This algorithm is used by companies such as Netflix, Amazon, and YouTube to suggest products, movies, or videos that they think a user might be interested in based on their previous viewing or purchase history. The goal of a recommendation algorithm is to personalize the user experience and improve engagement by showing them content that is more likely to meet their interests and preferences.


# HP Computers are racist

- I don't think that was done on purpose because I believe that they didn't get enought data on african americans and this shows that in the video the camera won't follow the african american but it will follow the caucasian female. 
- Next time they should get more data using everybody, not just one type of a person.
- Also this is a very strong claim because there could have been techinical issues. If this has happened more that once, then I could see it.

# Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?

- A crowdsource idea for a school environment could be a student-led project to improve the school's facilities or programs. We can achieve this by the Start of identifying an issue that the students, staff, or community members want to address, such as a lack of study spaces or a need for new equipment in the gym. Then Gathering information and resources, Conducting research to gather information about the problem and gather resources such as funds, materials, and volunteers. Lastly Launching the project, Once you have gathered the resources, launch the project and keep the community informed about its progress.

# What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your project be better with crowdsourcing?

- Yes my groups project could be alot better with crowdsourcing because we would get many different inputs from lots of people and many different perspectivies. It would help us with creating new features and having great ideas with also helping with problem solving. This would be great it if had crowdsourcing.

# What kind of data could you capture at N@tM to make evening interesting?

- Well i could capture many different projects around all of the classrooms and give feedback to each one of the projects I find intresting to me, also create a blog about what i see at N@TM night.

1. There are several types of open-source licenses, and choosing the right one can have a significant impact on how your code is used and what others are able to do with it. Here are some of the most popular open-source licenses;
    - MIT License: The MIT License is one of the most permissive open-source licenses. It allows others to use, modify, and distribute your code for any purpose, as long as they include a copy of the license and preserve the copyright notice.

    - Apache License 2.0: The Apache License 2.0 is a more restrictive license than the MIT License. It requires that users of your code include a copy of the license, preserve the copyright notice, and state any changes they have made to your code.

    - GNU General Public License (GPL): The GPL is a copyleft license, meaning that derivative works must also be released under the GPL. This means that if someone uses your code to create a new project, they must also open source that project under the GPL.

    - BSD 3-Clause License: The BSD 3-Clause License is similar to the MIT License but has some additional restrictions. For example, it requires that users of your code include a copy of the license and preserve the copyright notice.

2. The text discusses the impact of software licenses, specifically the General Public License (GPL), on businesses like Qualcomm. The GPL requires any derivative work to be free and open source, which could potentially void a company's rights to charge for software and patents. The author highlights the importance of knowing the type of software license one is using, as it could have a significant impact on business. The text mentions different types of licenses, including the Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal, Open Source MIT License, and Open Source GPL License. The author discusses the requirement to comply with the terms of licenses and the need to cite sources. The text also touches on the concept of Digital Rights Management (DRM) and the challenge of understanding the impact of Creative Commons licenses on individuals and businesses. 

3. I am going to keep the apache license 2.0 because its A permissive license whose main conditions require preservation of copyright and license notices. Contributors provide an express grant of patent rights. Licensed works, modifications, and larger works may be distributed under different terms and without source code. This works for me. For my Group's license we used the MIT license because its free to us first of all, also the Permissions is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files, to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

# 5.6

1.  Phone number
    Email address
    Date of birth
    Full name

2. I think that The protection of PII is an important issue and it's important to take appropriate measures to secure personal information and prevent unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. It is very important to keep the right information disclosed and not able to be seen.

3. Good Passwords:
    - Length: A minimum length of 12 characters or more.
    Complexity: A mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters is ideal.
    Uniqueness: The password should not be a word found in a dictionary or a commonly used password.

   Bad Passwords
    - Length: Short passwords that are less than 8 characters are easily guessable.
    Simplicity: Passwords that are just a word or a simple combination of words 
    ("password123") are easily crackable.
    Predictability: Passwords that are based on easily accessible personal information (name, birthdate, address) are also not secure.

4. Symmetric encryption, also known as shared secret encryption, uses a single key to encrypt and decrypt the data. In this type of encryption, both the sender and the receiver have the same key, and this key is used to encrypt the data before transmission and decrypt the data upon receipt. The key must be kept confidential and must be securely exchanged between the sender and the receiver before any data transmission can occur.

5. AWS Key Management Service (KMS) managed keys: With KMS, you can create, manage, and use encryption keys to encrypt your data in AWS services. KMS provides a highly available key management service that makes it easy to create, rotate, and manage encryption keys used to encrypt data at rest.

6. one phishing technique is called "spear phishing," where the attacker targets a specific individual or group with a personalized email that is designed to trick the recipient into divulging sensitive information. The email may contain personal information about the recipient, such as their name, job title, or interests, in an attempt to build trust and convince them to take the desired action.
