Whats the problem with Dopamine? Well having too much dopmaine is not good for you because it is linked to being more competitive, aggressive and having poor impulse control. It can also lead to conditions that include ADHD, binge eating, and addiction. It is not a parent conspiracy, Dopamine is a real neurotransmitter. Dopamine imbalances can be caused by genetic or environmental factors, such as drug use or certain medical conditions. For me personal I don't find an issue with dopmaine but I know some people who do which leads to them not paying attention and hard time staying focused.
