# Postitve effects

The positive effects of changing the theme was that I learned that fastpages has different versions of how you can create and make your website look.

# Negative effects 

the negative effects of changing the theme was that It switched everything around and pushed it all the way to the left side of the screen and you can't use the top tabs that include about me, search, vocab, the table, and catergories which makes the theme not beneficial.
