# Night@Museum
- Night at the museum is a night at del norte from 6-7:30 pm and this is a night where family, friends, and students can come to del norte and take a trip around all of the elective classes. Ceramics, 3d Animation, Ap Computer Science, Drawing/Painting, and AP Art studio were displaying their Final projects to Friends and family.
- ( This was a very fun night and I enjoyed looking at all of the art pieces and I can't wait to be back again )

# In the End

- Overall the expirence at the night of the museum was really fun and I love doing this every year and get to see many different great projects that people have really worked hard on and get to interact with your friends, or even people that you haven't seen in a while. Overall 10/10.
