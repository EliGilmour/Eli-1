# Night@Museum
- Night at the museum is a night at del norte from 6-7:30 pm and this is a night where family, friends, and students can come to del norte and take a trip around all of the elective classes. Ceramics, 3d Animation, Ap Computer Science, Drawing/Painting, and AP Art studio were displaying their Final projects to Friends and family.
- ( This was a very fun night and I enjoyed looking at all of the art pieces and I can't wait to be back again )
