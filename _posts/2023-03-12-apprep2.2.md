# Practice Problem

![photo]({{site.baseurl}}/images/33.png)

- Original = 142 bytes
- Compressed = 80 bytes
- Dictionary = 31 bytes
- Compression = 21.83%

![photo]({{site.baseurl}}/images/33.jpeg)

- The photo shows lossy data compression because the photo quality in the background keeps getting worse quality and soon becomes very hard to see the background.
