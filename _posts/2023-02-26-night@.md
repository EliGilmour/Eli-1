# Night@Museum
- Night at the museum is a night at del norte from 6-7:30 pm and this is a night where family, friends, and students can come to del norte and take a trip around all of the elective classes. Ceramics, 3d Animation, Ap Computer Science, Drawing/Painting, and AP Art studio were displaying their Final projects to Friends and family.
- ( This was a very fun night and I enjoyed looking at all of the art pieces and I can't wait to be back again )

- This is Olivia Haffie's art ( drawing and Painting )
- This drawing stood out to me because the colors on this piece are amazing and are very bright which caught my eye.
- I like how she used many different shapes and different shades of colors.

- This webiste really caught my eye because first off I love looking at home in my free time, Its cool looking at different designs that people come up with.
- This webiste stood out because they have some really cool features like where you can book your stay using a calendar of 2023.
- I like the design of the webiste and overall they did a great job.

- This photo is very cool to me because I love gaming and its really cool how they used blender to create these pieces and Ive taken the class and its not easy to use and this person did a great job.
- The background and the main piece really blends together and the color scheme is very well thought of and looks very good.
- Great Job Jame lee.

- Overall the expirence at the night of the museum was really fun and I love doing this every year and get to see many different great projects that people have really worked hard on and get to interact with your friends, or even people that you haven't seen in a while. Overall 10/10.
