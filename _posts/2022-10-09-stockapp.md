# The Idea
- we are going to use polygon.io which is an api and we are creating a stock website/app that shows the three big stock funds and it will display how well each stock has done in the past 2-3 years.

# Free perks with Polygon.io
- End of Day Data
- 5 API Calls / Minute
- 2 Years Historical Data
- 100% Market Coverage
- Reference Data
- Fundamental Data
- Corporate Actions
- Aggregate Bars

# Team roles
- jeffery -> DevOps
- Josh -> Frontend
- Chris -> Backend
- Khalid -> Frontend
- Eli -> Backend
- ryan -> scrum master
