Scrum board

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Scrum Process.png)

# First Idea
- data abstraction with a 2D array when loading the board and pieces.
- procedural abstraction with how the player interacts with the screen and interacts with the pieces on the board.

> Important: Pay attention! It's important.
