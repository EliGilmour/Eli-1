Scrum board

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Scrum Process.png)

# First Idea
- data abstraction with a 2D array when loading the board and pieces.
- procedural abstraction with how the player interacts with the screen and interacts with the pieces on the board.



# Team roles
- jeffery -> DevOps
- Josh -> Frontend
- Chris -> Backend
- Khalid -> Frontend
- Eli -> Backend
- ryan -> scrum master
