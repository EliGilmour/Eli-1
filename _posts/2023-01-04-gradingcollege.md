# Submission 1

|---|---|
|Row 1| 1 | 
|Row 2| 1 | 
|Row 3| 1 |
|Row 4| 0 |
|Row 5| 1 |
|Row 6| 1 |
|Final Score| 5/6 |

1: They get points because The video demonstrates the running of the program including input, output, and program functionallly.

2: They get points because it includes two program code segments - one that shows how data has been stored in this list - one that shows the data in this same list being used as part of fulfilling the program’s purpose.

3: They get points because it includes a program code segment that shows a list being used to manage complexity in the program. ( he explains well on what would happen if sideIndex was not used)

4: They get no points beacuse The code segment consisting of the procedure is not included in the written responses section. The procedure is a built-in or existing procedure or language structure, such as an event handler or main method.

5: They get points because The response explains in great detail how the algorithm in the procedure works so it can be
recreated. The student-developed algorithm within procedure.

6: they get points because it describes two calls to the selected procedure identified in written response 3c. Each call must pass a  different arguments that causes a different segment of code in the algorithm to execute. describes the conditions being tested by each call to the procedure.

1: The video demonstrates the running of the program functionality,
output, and Input. Shows clearly how the program works and many different examples.

2: The written response includes two program code segments: one that shows how data has been stored in
this list and one that shows the data in this same list being
used as part of fulfilling the program’s purpose. It also identifies the name of the variable representing the list being used in this response.
