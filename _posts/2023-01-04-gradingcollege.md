1: They get points because The video demonstrates the running of the program including input, output, and program functionallly.

2: They get points because it includes two program code segments - one that shows how data has been stored in this list - one that shows the data in this same list being used as part of fulfilling the programâ€™s purpose.

3: They get points because it includes a program code segment that shows a list being used to manage complexity in the program. ( he explains well on what would happen if sideIndex was not used)

4: They get no points beacuse The code segment consisting of the procedure is not included in the written responses section. The procedure is a built-in or existing procedure or language structure, such as an event handler or main method.

5: They get points because The response explains in great detail how the algorithm in the procedure works so it can be
recreated. The student-developed algorithm within procedure.

6: they get points because it describes two calls to the selected procedure identified in written response 3c. Each call must pass a  different arguments that causes a different segment of code in the algorithm to execute. describes the conditions being tested by each call to the procedure.
