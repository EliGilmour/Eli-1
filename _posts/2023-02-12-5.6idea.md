# Blog Reflection

1.  Phone number
    Email address
    Date of birth
    Full name

2. I think that The protection of PII is an important issue and it's important to take appropriate measures to secure personal information and prevent unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. It is very important to keep the right information disclosed and not able to be seen.

3. Good Passwords:
    - Length: A minimum length of 12 characters or more.
    Complexity: A mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters is ideal.
    Uniqueness: The password should not be a word found in a dictionary or a commonly used password.

   Bad Passwords
    - Length: Short passwords that are less than 8 characters are easily guessable.
    Simplicity: Passwords that are just a word or a simple combination of words 
    ("password123") are easily crackable.
    Predictability: Passwords that are based on easily accessible personal information (name, birthdate, address) are also not secure.
