# Logic Gates

# 1. 

- Logic gates can be used to execute basic computer functions by implementing Boolean logic operations on binary inputs, which can be used to perform arithmetic, comparison, and control operations in a computer's central processing unit (CPU) and other digital circuits.

# 2.

- Boolean operations are abstract mathematical operations defined in Boolean algebra, while logic gates are physical devices or circuits that implement these operations by controlling the flow of electricity through them. Boolean operations are the abstract concepts used to describe logical relationships between variables, while logic gates are the physical components that perform these operations in digital circuits.
