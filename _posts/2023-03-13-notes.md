- The code defines a class Image_Data and several functions that allow creating objects from images, scaling them, and displaying them in Jupyter Notebook.

The Image_Data class takes in several parameters to create an object that represents an image file. It opens the file using PIL and scales it to a base width of 320 pixels. It also converts the image into an HTML format that can be displayed in a Jupyter Notebook. There are two properties html and html_grey that return HTML code to display the image and its gray-scale version.

The image_data() function returns a tuple with a path and a list of images. The default path is set to images/ and the default list includes several images.

The image_objects() function creates a list of Image_Data objects from the list of images returned by image_data(). The list of objects can be used to display the images.

The code includes a block that demonstrates how to display the images in Jupyter Notebook. It loops through the list of Image_Data objects and displays the image along with some metadata. It first displays the original image and then displays a gray-scale version.

Overall, this code allows creating objects from images and displaying them in a Jupyter Notebook. It provides a convenient way to work with images and analyze them.
