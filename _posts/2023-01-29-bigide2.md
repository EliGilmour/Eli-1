### Get involved in online communities: Joining online communities that share your interests can be a great way to connect with like-minded people and learn new things.

### Learn how to code: Understanding how to code can give you more control over the technology you use and enable you to create your own digital tools and apps.

### Share knowledge and resources: Offer guidance and provide resources that can help the person gain the skills and knowledge they need to become more empowered.

### Provide mentorship: Offer support and guidance as the person navigates the digital world.

### Offer technical assistance: Provide hands-on help with setting up accounts, using software, or troubleshooting problems.

- If a student at Del Norte HS needed help on a problem that they have, say for example in coding, I could help them and give them assistance to what ever the problem is.
