- Question 20 

![photo]({{site.baseurl}}/images/99991.png)

- My answer = (avgRating ≥ 4.0) OR ((prcRange = "lo") AND (prcRange = "med"))

- Correct Answer = (avgRating ≥ 4.0) AND ((prcRange = "lo") OR (prcRange = "med"))

- Notes: This expression evaluates to true only for restaurants with the correct price range (when prcRange equals "lo" or "med") and the correct customer rating (when avgRating ≥ 4.0).

- Reflection

    - I feel like I understand Big idea 2 from what is shown from my test score and after learning about it for the past few weeks.
