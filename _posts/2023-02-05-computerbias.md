# Intentional or Purposeful bias

- Google “What age groups use Facebook” vs “… TikTok”?
    - My take is that more of the older people use facebook than younger people ( teens ) and younger people use instagram more. Each app requires you to enter a birthday, but it is really easy to lie about the birthday. So there could be really young people on both apps with out knowing. I think it is harmful because their shouldn't be any young kids on both of these apps, because their is some cases of sensitive content.
