# Intentional or Purposeful bias

- Google “What age groups use Facebook” vs “… TikTok”?
    - My take is that more of the older people use facebook than younger people ( teens ) and younger people use instagram more. Each app requires you to enter a birthday, but it is really easy to lie about the birthday. So there could be really young people on both apps with out knowing. I think it is harmful because their shouldn't be any young kids on both of these apps, because their is some cases of sensitive content.

- Why do virtual assistants have female voices?
    - Virtual assistans are usually female voices because many studies have found that female voices tend to articulate vowel sounds more clearly which makes them easier to understand. In my opinion, I find female voices more soothing.

- Talk about an algorithm that influences your decisions, think about these companies? (ie FAANG - Facebook, Amazon, Apple,Netflix, Google)
    - One algorithm that influences decisions made by several of these companies is the recommendation algorithm. This algorithm is used by companies such as Netflix, Amazon, and YouTube to suggest products, movies, or videos that they think a user might be interested in based on their previous viewing or purchase history. The goal of a recommendation algorithm is to personalize the user experience and improve engagement by showing them content that is more likely to meet their interests and preferences.


# HP Computers are racist

- I don't think that was done on purpose because I believe that they didn't get enought data on african americans and this shows that in the video the camera won't follow the african american but it will follow the caucasian female. 
- Next time they should get more data using everybody, not just one type of a person.
- Also this is a very strong claim because there could have been techinical issues. If this has happened more that once, then I could see it.
