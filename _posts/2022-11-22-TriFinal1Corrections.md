# Question 28 ( wrong )

![photo]({{site.baseurl}}/images/question 28.png)

- I put answer A because I thought that if the number of units is greater than 25 it would charge them 7 dollars after that.
- But Answer C is correct because it shows that when the number of units is greater than 25, it would charge them 7 dollars and the code looks like
cost<- 25 * 5 + (numUnits -25) * 7

# Question 48 ( wrong )

![photo]({{site.baseurl}}/images/wrong answer 2 test corr.png)

- I put answer D because the answer is x,y and z and I thought the since 50 is equal to 50, I thought that it would have a value of 50
- Answer C is correct because the value of y is initially 50, but its value is changed to 75 in the fifth statement.

# Questions I searched up 

- Question 38 because this question was very confusing to me and I didn't know what temp means in the code segment. I don't get where they got temp.
- Question 30 because it talks about data abstraction and I don't really get what that means.
- Question 26 because I didn't know that Boolean means that the status of whether a store is open can be represented using only the values true and false, I didn't know this applies to isOpen.
- Question 23 because I didn't know The position of the runner is sampled at regular intervals to approximate the real-word position.
