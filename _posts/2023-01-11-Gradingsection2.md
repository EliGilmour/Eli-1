# Submission 1

|---|---|
|Row 1| 1 | 
|Row 2| 0 | 
|Row 3| 0 |
|Row 4| 1 |
|Row 5| 0 |
|Row 6| 1  |
|Final Score| 3/6 |

1: I would give this submission a 1 on this row of the grading because this shows that when you input something into the game, theiir is an output that shows up which says if you got a point or not. It also shows the program functionally running smoothly.

2: I would give this submission a 0 on this row because there is only one list is mentioned in this written response and we need more than one to get the point. The list also doesn't help the program function any better or more efficient.

3: I would give this submission a 0 in this row because it does provide a list, but very minimal information as to how it works or what it is. It needs to have more explantation for how and what the list is. 

4: I would give this submission a 1 in this row because it has two program code segments one showing a student-developed procedure Requirements for program code segments with at least one parameter that has an effect
on the functionality of the procedure. Also one showing where the student-developed procedure is being called.

5: I would give this submission a 0 on this row because the student-developed algorithm within procedure, evaluateGuess, includes sequencing,
and iteration and selection. Also their was very minimal description included.

6: I would give this submission a 1 on this row because the response describes two different calls to the specific procedure to result in different code
being executed. Also The response describes the conditions being tested.

# Submission 2 

|---|---|
|Row 1| 1 | 
|Row 2| 1 | 
|Row 3| 0 |
|Row 4| 0 |
|Row 5| 1 |
|Row 6| 1 |
|Final Score| 4/6 |

1: I would give this submission a 1 because The video demonstrates the running of the program, showing input into the program through keyboard typing. Also describes the input and output of the program demonstrated in the video. 

2: I would give this submission a 1 because the respone has two code segments, one that shows how the data and program works and stored in a list. Also one segment that shows the data in the same list being used to make the program work.

3: I would give this submission a 0 because the code segment lists are not separtely included in the written response. The written response also doesn't name the list being used. Their could be more of an explantation included too.

4: I would give this submission a 0 because the code segment consisting of the procudure is not included in the written response. The written response describes what the procedure does independently without relating it to the
overall function of the program.

5: I would give this submission a 1 because the code segment includes sequencing, selection, and iteration. Also the explantation is in depth and very detailed on how the algorithm works.

6: I would give this submission a 1 because the program describes two calls to the selected procedure
identified in written response 3c. Also the program describes the conditions being tested by each call to the procedure. 

# Submission 3 

|---|---|
|Row 1| 0 | 
|Row 2| 1 | 
|Row 3| 0 |
|Row 4| 0 |
|Row 5| 1 |
|Row 6| 1 |
|Final Score| 3/6 |

1: I would give this submission a 0 on this row because the program did not show input and out well and the program functionally doesn't show clearly. Also the response describes the input and the output. For input, the response states that “the
different button clicks to change the screens and the character names selected from each
drop-down box.” Could use more explantation.

2: I would give this submission a 1 on this row because the program includes code segments that shows how the data is stored in the list. Also how the data is the same list being used to help the program run better. 

3: I would give this submission a 0 on this row because 

4: I would give this submission a 0 on this row because 

5: I would give this submission a 1 on this row because 

6: I would give this submission a 1 on this row because
