    - 3.b.iii.: I am fetching from an api which loads the table full of cars. 
    - 3.b.iv.: The data that is represented in my program is the names and year and model of each car that we have up for rental on hour homepage which is shown in a table that is fetching from an api.
    - 3.b.v.: Using the array of car from the list and that its fecthing from an api makes the program alot more user friendly and save times and runs smoother because you don't have to manualy input each car and their features. The api does that from fetching and is shown in a table.
