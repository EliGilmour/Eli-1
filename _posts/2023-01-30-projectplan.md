# What I will Be Working On

- So for me personally, I will be working on a feature that helps make the website more professional and more features to use. I will be mainly working on how to display the cars and the frontend of the webiste and what people will be looking at when they click onto the website. I will make it as user friendly as possible. I will get help from the backend to store all of these cars so I don't have to maunally input them. ( Making more efficient methods!)
