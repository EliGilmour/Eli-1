# Design Process
## 1. Choosing a topic
Before I started to make my quiz I decided I wanted to choose a topic that was revalant to me and that others can learn from when takng my quiz. I chose to create my quiz about the math I am doing in my math class.( AFA )

## 2. Writing the questions
After I chose my topic for my quiz, I searched through my math notebook to find questions on the topics we work on in class. I created these questions around what to expect in teh AFA math class.

## 3. Creating my Quiz
The first step to creating my quiz was the homepage and I created something that was related to my topic, but also added some fun colors to make the homepage more intreasting. My quiz will have three questions that you have to answer in a different way each time. Including multiple choice, dropdown menu( true or false ), and check all that apply. Then at the end it will take you to the page that tells you your score.
