# Notes
- Pair programming
  - One programmer is the driver, who writes code, and the other programmer is the observer who reviews each line of code as it is typed in
  - The two programmers work together as a pair

- Think,Pair,Share
  - The first step is for each of the students to think through each problem by themselves, and then you come too as a group and collaborate, and then share out to the class.

- computng collaboration
  - Collaboration that includes diverse perspectives that helps avoid bias of the development of computing innovations. 

# What I took from this videos
- After watching these videos, I see how important collaboration is for heading towards sucess. For example, computer science takes alot of communication and collaboration for each of the students to find sucess in their projects. All the time you need to ask fellow students for help on something or their perspective on your project.
